  printerId: ObjectId,
  file: {
    cloudinaryUrl: "...",
    publicId: "...",
    originalName: "document.pdf",
    format: "pdf",
    sizeKB: 250
  },
  settings: {
    pages: "1-5",
    copies: 2,
    color: false,
    duplex: true,
    paperType: "A4"
  },
  cost: {
    totalCost: 20
  },
  payment: {
    amount: 20,
    status: "pending", // pending, completed, cancelled
    method: "cash"
  },
  status: "pending", // pending, approved, rejected, cancelled
  timing: {
    submittedAt: Date,
