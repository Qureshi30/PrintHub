# Student Queries System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete student support ticket system that allows students to submit queries through the Support page, which are saved to MongoDB and displayed in the admin panel for review and response.

---

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Implementation

#### **Query Model** (`server/src/models/Query.js`)
Created a Mongoose schema with the following fields:
- `studentId` - Clerk user ID
- `studentName` - Automatically combines firstName + lastName
- `studentEmail` - Student's email from Clerk
- `category` - Type of query (Printing Issues, Payment & Billing, Account Settings, General)
- `subject` - Brief description
- `message` - Detailed message
- `status` - Open, In-Progress, Resolved, Closed
- `priority` - Low, Medium, High, Urgent
- `adminResponse` - Admin's response text
- `respondedBy` - Admin user ID who responded
- `respondedAt` - Timestamp of response
- `createdAt` - **Auto-generated creation time**
- `updatedAt` - Auto-updated modification time

#### **Query Routes** (`server/src/routes/queryRoutes.js`)
Created comprehensive API endpoints:

**Student Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/queries` - Submit a new support ticket
- `GET /api/queries/my-tickets` - Get all tickets submitted by logged-in student

**Admin Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/queries/admin/all` - Get all support tickets with filtering
  - Supports query params: `status`, `priority`, `search`, `limit`, `page`
- `GET /api/queries/admin/:id` - Get specific query details
- `PUT /api/queries/admin/:id` - Update query status/priority/response
- `DELETE /api/queries/admin/:id` - Delete a query
- `GET /api/queries/admin/stats/overview` - Get statistics (total, open, resolved, etc.)

#### **Server Integration** (`server/src/index.js`)
- Added `const queryRoutes = require('./routes/queryRoutes')`
- Registered route: `app.use('/api/queries', queryRoutes)`

---

### 2. Frontend Implementation

#### **Support Page** (`src/pages/shared/Support.tsx`)
Updated the existing support page to save tickets to database:
- Added `useAuth()` hook to get authentication token
- Created `handleSubmitTicket()` function that:
  - Validates form inputs
  - Sends POST request to `/api/queries` with category, subject, message
  - Displays success/error toast notifications
  - Clears form after successful submission
- Added loading state (`isSubmitting`) to prevent duplicate submissions
- Uses Clerk authentication to automatically capture student info

#### **Admin Queries Page** (`src/pages/admin/Queries.tsx`)
Created a comprehensive admin dashboard to manage queries:

**Features:**
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Shows total, open, in-progress, resolved, closed, and urgent query counts
- **Advanced Filtering**:
  - Search by student name, email, subject, or message
  - Filter by status (all, open, in-progress, resolved, closed)
  - Filter by priority (all, low, medium, high, urgent)
- **Queries Table**: Displays all queries with:
  - Student name and email
  - Category badge
  - Subject and message preview
  - Status badge (color-coded)
  - Priority badge (color-coded)
  - Creation timestamp
  - View and Delete actions
- **Query Detail Dialog**:
  - View full query details
  - Student information display
  - Subject and complete message
  - Update status dropdown
  - Update priority dropdown
  - Admin response textarea
  - Save and send response button
  - Shows last response timestamp if applicable

**UI Components:**
- Statistics cards with icons and color coding
- Real-time filtering and search
- Responsive table layout
- Modal dialog for detailed view/editing
- Badge components for status and priority
- Refresh button to reload data

---

### 3. Routing & Navigation

#### **App.tsx**
- Added import: `import Queries from "./pages/admin/Queries"`
- Added route:
```tsx
<Route path="/admin/queries" element={
  <ProtectedRoute requiredRole="admin">
    <AdminLayout><Queries /></AdminLayout>
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

#### **Admin Header** (`src/components/layout/AdminHeader.tsx`)
- Added "Queries" navigation item with MessageSquare icon
- Positioned between "Printers" and "Error Logs"
- Includes active state highlighting

## üìä Data Flow

### Student Submits Ticket:
1. Student fills form on `/support` page
2. Clicks "Submit Ticket"
3. Frontend calls `POST /api/queries` with:
   - Category (from dropdown)
   - Subject (from input)
   - Message (from textarea)
4. Backend extracts student info from Clerk JWT:
   - `studentId` = userId
   - `studentName` = firstName + lastName
   - `studentEmail` = primaryEmailAddress
5. Creates Query document in MongoDB with:
   - All student info
   - Form data
   - `status: 'open'`
   - `priority: 'medium'`
   - `createdAt: new Date()` (automatic)
6. Returns success response
7. Frontend shows success toast and clears form

### Admin Views Queries:
1. Admin navigates to `/admin/queries`
2. Page loads statistics and all queries
3. Admin can:
   - Search/filter queries
   - Click "View" to see details
   - Update status and priority
   - Add admin response
   - Delete queries
4. All changes saved to database
5. Statistics update in real-time
